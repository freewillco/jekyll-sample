The circled area on this 1934 air photo depicts woodland on 200 John Street.
Note, in the northeast corner of the air photo, the proximity to Paradise Grove, one of the oldest and most provincially significant woodland remaining in Canada today.

The majority of the 200 John Street property was cleared of all vegetation in November to December 2016 in support of a declared agricultural development objective (expanded vineyard), under the terms of NPCA Good Forestry Practices

The actual tree-clearing, however, substantially exceeded the cut area identified in the Permit. While the northern Harvest Area block was retained and selectively cut as described in the application plan, the remainder of the property was clear cut,
including most of the southern Harvest Area.

No standing trees remain in the majority of the subject property (Figure 4). Most tree stumps appear to have been ground to below the surface level in this cleared area. Shredded wood material from the cutting operation has been spread over the ground surface (Figures 4 and 5).
