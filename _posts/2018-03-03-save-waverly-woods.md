With any development IN a community comes responsibility TO the community. Development is inevitable, but it must be done wisely in the best interests of the people!

DID YOU KNOW? Harbourtown Development will:

- Destroy at least 30% of the mature woodland at Waverly Beach?
- Destroy wildlife habitat and corridors to the lake, and nesting habitat for endangered birds? This area is a vital stop over for migratory birds and butterflies.
- Build a huge unsightly 10 storey condo, increasing traffic and pollution.
- Ruin one of the last peaceful sanctuaries for Fort Erie residents, Western New Yorkers, and others who have enjoyed it for over a century. Greenspaces have been scientifically proven essential for improving mental health, reducing stress and encouraging human activity.
- Damage vital history—Aboriginal, African (NAACP), Erie Beach Amusement Park, and the site of the most battle deaths on Canadian soil, the siege of Fort Erie in 1814. Many burial sites of those killed in action are still not accounted for. It seems the archeological and historical importance of this site has not yet been thoroughly ad-dressed.
- Remove a crucial green space, thus decreasing property values for nearby residences. Green-spaces increase property values.
- A letter to Council from the Ontario Sierra Club states Council misinterpreted Provincial Policy by allowing development in this important area. The Environmental Impact Statement inadequately addresses environmental issues and has not been subject to peer review.

It is OUR town. OUR voices must be heard.
