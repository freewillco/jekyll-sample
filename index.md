### Forest Loss in the Niagara Region of Ontario

The Niagara Region supports some of the most significant and diverse forested areas remaining in Canada today. Yet forest loss continues to occur.

### Carolinian Forest

The Niagara Region of Ontario supports some of the most significant and diverse forested areas remaining in Canada today. The Niagara Region is situated in Ontario’s Carolinian Zone which is the southern most region in Canada and contains a diverse flora and fauna including many species not found elsewhere in the country or considered to be at risk.

Why then, in the most biologically productive area of our country which supports over 40% of Canada’s plant species and the highest number of species at risk, are we still clearing original, intact forested areas?
